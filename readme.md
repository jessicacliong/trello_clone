# Trello Clone

## Scope

This is an exercise to practice my newly acquired knowledge and skills in Databases, Postgresql, SQLAlchemy, FLask and Marshmallow.
The aim of this project is to create task cards that mimic an existing project management website called Trello.
I am practicing to make HTTP requests, especially GET requests and produce a JSON file output of my information onto a local server.
